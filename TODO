 - Fix importing convention (relative/absolute)

 - Overhaul/refactor frontend: normalisation, language identification,
   phonetisation, syllabification and stress/tone assignment -- after
   Yoruba lessons learnt... (after PhD)

 - Consider moving some components (e.g. Yoruba tokenizer in
   tokenizers.py)
